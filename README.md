# vfio-gpu-script
A gpu script generated by AI, useful for blacklisting AMD or Nvidia GPU's on a dual boot machine for virtualization.

## How to activate

simply clone this archive (or download this script), then make this script executable with sudo chmod +x; afterwards run ```./vfio-gen-aio.sh``` in your terminal of choice.

What you'll need, and what I'll add in later.

virt-manager, qemu-full, a rom for your GPU; you cna use a rom dumping utility or simply look on the internet [you can also check my previous repo on how to do so](https://github.com/Nthompson096/KVM-GPU-Passthrough#creating-your-rom).

For trying to pass though Nvidia you'll need to apply this patch and install either of these kernels listed in this wiki [if you use arch] (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF#Bypassing_the_IOMMU_groups_(ACS_override_patch)
And for the sake of it, here's a video from [Pavol Elsig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBEzshbGPhQ) which should be an easier guide also a level1tech guide [here](https://forum.level1techs.com/t/how-to-apply-acs-override-patch-kubuntu-18-10-kernel-4-18-16/134204/2).

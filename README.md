# vfio-gpu-script
A gpu script generated by AI, useful for blacklisting AMD or Nvidia GPU's on a dual boot machine for virtualization.

## How to activate

simply clone this archive (or download this script), then make this script executable with sudo chmod +x; afterwards run ```./vfio-gen-aio.sh``` in your terminal of choice.

What you'll need, and what I'll add in later.

virt-manager, qemu-full, a rom for your GPU; you cna use a rom dumping utility or simply look on the internet (you can also check my previous repo on how to do so).
